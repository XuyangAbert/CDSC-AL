# CDSC_AL: A Clustering-based Data Stream Classification framework using Active Learning

There are two codes with different settings for the benchmark data sterams:

  1. The main_final_draft.py file is developed for arranging data streams to have abrupt drifts and run this code on 
  
  Synthetic-1, Synthetic-2, Sea, and Shuttle
  
  2. The main_final_draft4.py file is developed for simulating data streams with gradual concept drift and run this code on 
  
  KDD cup 99, Forest covtype, Gas Sensor Drift, MNIST, CiFAR-10


To run these two files with different datasets, go to line 17 to change the name of dataset

In line 11, the global variable label_ratio allows for users to change the proportion of labeled data in each incoming data chunk

Two different evaluation metrics are used: 
  
  1. BAcc1Hist: A vector of the balanced classification accuracy values for the entire data streams
  
  2. F1Hist: A vector of the macro-average values of the F1-score for the entire data streams
